**Display some useful information in the reports module.**

## ‚ùì What does it do?

Display some useful information in the reports module, like : 

* list of eID
* list of CommandController and Symfony Commands
* list of all the contents and plugins on the instance (used or not) with filters
* list of xclass declared
* list of hooks declared
* lot of information about the website : TYPO3, System Environment Variables, PHP, MySQL, Apache, Crontab, encoding...
* list of log errors group by number of occurrences (sorting by last time seen or number)
* list of all websites declared with information : domain, sys_template, number of pages...
* list of extensions with information : number of tables, last version date, visual comparison between current and TER extension to see what could be hard coded
* list of all the Middlewares (PSR-15) for frontend and backend

All this tools can really help you during migration or new existing project (to have a global reports of the system).
Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any good ideas.
