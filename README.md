
Useful informations in the reports module:

* list of xclass
* list of ajax functions
* list of hooks
* list of cliKeys
* list of eID
* list of ExtDirect
* list of realurl errors
* list of log errors (group by type)
* quick check database integrity
* list of used content type & plugins
* list of extensions with tool to compare local and TER extension (diff)
* general status of the system: TYPO3, PHP, Apache, MySQL, Crontab, encoding, php vars...

It can really help you during migration or new existing project (to have a global reports of the system).
